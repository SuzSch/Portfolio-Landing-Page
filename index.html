  <h2>Come take a look at some of the projects I have made so far</h2>

  <h3 class="project"><a href="https://github.com/SuzSch/boring-lecture">Boring Lecture</a></h3>
  
  <p>Some may call it boring, but I call it a great learning experience. While making this project I learned some new skills such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Styling with the class attribute</li>
    <li>Styling with id attribute</li>
    <li>The difference between the two and when to use use which</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h3 class="project"><a href="https://github.com/SuzSch/First-Push">First First-Push</a></h3>
  
  <p>This project was made in day two of class and it was a doozy. I learned all about Git, with its many step process and about GitHub and how use it to track your work and share it with others. Some lessons learned were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to set up new remote repositories in GitHub</li>
    <li>How to push and pull to and from a remote repository </li>
    <li>How to clone a remote repository to make it a remote repository</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="project"><a href="https://github.com/SuzSch/happy-hour">Happy Hour</a></h3>
  
  <p>Let's keep the fun times going! This is a project I have been working on in my own time to practice my new found skills and to hopefully have a simple living webpage where we can post upcoming after school happy hours. This is still very much a WIP but in the future I hope to add these features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some kind of fun animated background. Haven't quite figured that one out yet.</li>
    <li>Some kind of Google Maps feature to link address of the place we are going that week.</li>
    <li>A section to post pics from previous happy hour outtings.</li>
  </ul>
